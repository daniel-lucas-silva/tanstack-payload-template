  Guidelines for implementing real-time features, WebSockets, and collaborative
  canvases. Use when the app requires chat, live collaboration, multiplayer games,
  or notifications. Covers server-authoritative state, event-based communication,

# Real-Time & Multi-User Guidelines

## Critical Rule: No Simulations

When building applications with multi-user or real-time features, **you MUST use
real infrastructure**:

| Feature Type       | Required Implementation                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Chat / Messaging   | WebSockets with server-side state          |
| Live Collaboration | WebSockets with server-side state          |
| Multiplayer Games  | WebSockets with server-authoritative state |
| Notifications      | Push notifications or WebSocket events     |

## Forbidden Patterns

**DO NOT** use these patterns to fake multi-user behavior (unless asked by the
user):

- Using AI/LLM responses to simulate other users
- Using `setTimeout`/`setInterval` to fake real-time updates
- Storing multi-user state only in client-side memory (not synced to a server)

## Architecture Principles

When implementing real-time multi-user features, follow these core principles:

### 1. Server as Source of Truth

The server maintains the authoritative state. Clients are views of that state.

- All mutations flow through the server
- The server validates and broadcasts changes to all connected clients
- Never trust client-side state for critical data

### 2. Event-Based Communication

Use an event-driven pattern for real-time updates:

```
Client A sends action → Server processes → Server broadcasts to all clients
```

Events should be: - **Named clearly**: `object:created`, `cursor:moved`,
`user:joined` - **Minimal payload**: Send only changed data, not full state -
**Idempotent**: Applying the same event twice must not corrupt state

#### Idempotency in Practice

Event handlers for `create` operations must guard against duplicates: - **Check
existence**: Before adding an object, check if an object with that ID already
exists. - **Early return**: If it exists, skip the addition. - **Resilience**:
This protects against reconnection races, duplicate broadcasts, and network
retries.

`Update` operations are naturally idempotent (overwriting with the same value is
safe). `Delete` operations should be a no-op if the item does not exist.

### 3. Optimistic Updates with Reconciliation

For responsive UIs, apply changes optimistically on the client:

1.  Apply change locally immediately
2.  Send change to server
3.  If server rejects, rollback local change
4.  If server confirms, state is already correct

## Communication Patterns

### Presence Awareness

Track who is active in a session:

- **Join/Leave events**: Notify when users connect/disconnect
- **Active user list**: Server maintains list of connected users
- **User metadata**: Include name, color, cursor position as needed

### Reconnection Handling

Connections will drop. Plan for it:

- **Auto-reconnect**: Client should attempt reconnection automatically
- **State sync on reconnect**: Request full state from server after
  reconnecting
- **Pending changes queue**: Buffer local changes during disconnect, send on
  reconnect
- **Race condition awareness**: If a client adds an object, disconnects, then
  reconnects, the `init` payload may include that object. Without idempotent
  handlers, it appears twice. Always use idempotent event handlers regardless
  of server broadcast semantics.

### Rooms/Channels

For collaborative documents or sessions:

- **Room-based isolation**: Users in different rooms don't see each other's
  changes
- **Room ID from URL**: Derive room identity from document/session URL
- **Join on connect**: Client joins appropriate room immediately after
  connecting

## State Synchronization

### Initial Sync

When a client connects:

1.  Client connects and authenticates (if needed)
2.  Client joins appropriate room/channel
3.  Server sends full current state
4.  Client renders initial state

### Delta Updates

During active session:

- Send only what changed, not full state
- Include object IDs for targeted updates
- Use operation types: `create`, `update`, `delete`

### Conflict Resolution

When two users edit simultaneously:

| Approach                  | When to Use                                          |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Last-Write-Wins**       | Simple, acceptable for most collaborative UIs        |
| **Operational Transform** | Text editing, requires library support               |
| **CRDT**                  | Complex collaborative data, requires library support |

For most apps, **last-write-wins** is sufficient. The server applies changes in
order received and broadcasts the result.

## Full-Stack Integration

Real-time features require a server. Follow the Full-Stack guidelines to
configure it, then add WebSocket support.

### Key Points

- **Same port**: WebSocket server runs on port 3000 alongside HTTP
- **Upgrade handling**: WebSocket libraries handle HTTP→WS upgrade
  automatically
- **Order matters**: Initialize WebSocket handler with the HTTP server

### Framework-Specific Notes

- **Bun (este projeto)**: Use `Bun.serve<WSContext>` — o runtime já expõe
  upgrade nativo de WebSocket na mesma porta do HTTP (não use express).
- **React/Vite**: WebSocket server attaches to the HTTP server created for
  Express
- **Next.js**: Use custom server or API routes with WebSocket upgrade handling
- **Angular**: Same pattern as React - Express server with WebSocket
  attachment

## Canvas Library Selection

For collaborative canvas apps (design tools, whiteboards, editors):

| Use Case                                  | Recommended Library      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Default choice**                        | Konva with `react-konva` |
| Advanced features (beziers, filters, SVG) | Fabric.js v6+            |

**Why Konva for collaboration**: State-driven model matches
server-as-source-of-truth. Receive state from socket → update React state →
components re-render.

### Fabric.js v6+ Gotchas

If using Fabric, avoid these common version pitfalls:

| Issue                | Solution                                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Import syntax        | `import * as fabric from 'fabric'` (not named import) |
| `@types/fabric`      | Don't install - v6+ has built-in TypeScript types     |
| `getPointer` removed | Use `canvas.getScenePoint(e)` instead                 |
| `type` is read-only  | Strip before `.set()`: `const { type, id, ...rest } = |
| : : obj` :           |
| `loadFromJSON`       | Use `await canvas.loadFromJSON(json)` (async, not     |
| : : callback) :      |
| Canvas double-init   | Call `canvas.dispose()` in cleanup                    |

## Library API Verification

Before implementing canvas or complex real-time libraries:

1.  Check installed version in `package.json`
2.  Verify import syntax matches the installed major version
3.  Prefer libraries with stable APIs (e.g., Konva over Fabric.js)

---

## Preventing Infinite Sync Loops

When canvas/state changes trigger socket events:

- **Track update source**: Flag remote vs local changes (`isRemoteUpdate`)
- **Guard emission**: Skip emit when `isRemoteUpdate === true`
- **Strip identity props**: Remove `type`, `id` before calling `.set()`

---

## Canvas + WebSocket Checklist

When combining canvas libraries with real-time collaboration:

- [ ] Canvas instance stored in a ref (not component state)
- [ ] Cleanup on unmount (Fabric: `.dispose()`, Konva: `.destroy()`)
- [ ] Socket data arriving before canvas mount is buffered
- [ ] Continuous drag/resize events are throttled before emit
- [ ] Currently-selected objects skip incoming remote updates
